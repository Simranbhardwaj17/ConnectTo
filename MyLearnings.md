Mongo is a NoSQL DB. 
It's not a relational DB like MySQL or postgreS or anything like that where u have tables & columns, instead, we have docs

It's actually a document DB which is a certain type of NoSQL DB & it's very similar to JSON Syntax or JS objects. So, it pairs really well with Js or node applications

You can download mongoDB locally or in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas

Now we're using Atlas, cloud DB for few reasons:-
It's easier to manage. We don't have to go through an installation and dealing with local DB issues
Some using Windows, Linux, and Mac, and it's different on all systems
going to deploy on Heroku, which is a platform as a service. So u can't install a local instance of Mongo when you're using Heroku. You'd have to use something like DigitalOcean to actually install Mongo on the server. So, we have cloud DB that we can just connect to our app no matter where it's hosted locally or on Heroku


If u want to i locally and use it, u can code will be exact same. you'll just have a local connection string, instead of a remote one
